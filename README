This is a module for computing the difference between two files, two
strings, or any other two lists of things.  It uses an  intelligent
algorithm similar to (or identical to) the one used by the Unix `diff'
program.   It is guaranteed to find the *smallest possible* set of
differences.  

This package contains a few parts:

Algorithm::Diff
	Module that contains the `diff' function, which computes the
	differences betwen two lists and returns a data structure that
	represents these differences.  You can then use the data
	structure to generate a formatted output in whatever format
	you like.  The `diff' programs included in this package use
	Algorithm::Diff::diff to find the differences, and then
	theyjust format the output.  

	Algorithm::Diff also includes some other useful functions such
	as `LCS', which computes the longest common subsequence of two
	lists.

	A::D is suitable for many other uses.  For example, you could
	use it for finding the smallest set of differences between two
	strings, or for computing the most efficient way to update the
	screen if you were replacing `curses'.

diff.pl
	Implementation of `diff' in Perl that is as simple as possible
	so that you can see how it works.  The output format is not
	compatible with regular `diff'.

cdiff.pl
	`diff' that generates real context diffs in either traditional
	format or GNU unified format. Original contextless `context'
	diff supplied by Christian Murphy.  Modifications to make it
	into a real full-featured diff with -c and -u options supplied
	by Amir D. Karger.  

	Yes, you can use this program to generate patches.

THANKS SECTION

Huge thanks to Amir Karger for adding full context diff supprt to
	`cdiff.pl', and then for waiting patiently for five months
	while I let it sit in a closet and didn't release it.  Thank
	you thank you thank you, Amir!

Thanks to Christian Murphy for adding the first context diff format
	suppoort to `cdiff.pl'.

Thanks to Tim Bunce for his code that I haven't incorporated yet.

Thanks to David Eppstein for his lucid page on dynamic programming and
	the Longest Common Subsequences problem, which provided 2/3 of
	the inspiration for this project.

Thanks to Abigail for renaming her own modules so that this module
	could be Algorithm::Diff instead of Algorithms::Diff.

Thanks to Nat Torkington for being himself.

Thanks to the countless folks who showed up in comp.lang.perl.misc
	every month asking `how can I do `diff' in Perl' for the other
	1/3 of the inspiration.
