This package contains a few parts:

diff.pl
	Implementation of `diff' in Perl that is as simple as possible
	so that you can see how it works.  The output format is not
	compatible with regular `diff'.

cdiff.pl
	Christian Murphy's `diff' that produces real diffs that you
	can feed to `patch'.

Algorithm/LCS.pm
	The module that actually finds the differences.  diff.pl and
	cdiff.pl) just take the results from Algorithm::LCS and format
	them nicely.	

	A::L is suitable for many other uses.  For example, you could
	use it for finding the smallest set of differences between two
	strings, or for computing the most efficient way to update the
	screen if you were replacing `curses'.

THANKS SECTION

Thanks to Christian Murphy for writing `cdiff.pl'.  In this world
	there are the talkers and the doers, and Christian is
	obviously a doer.  

Thanks to Tim Bunce for his code that I haven't incorporated yet.

Thanks to David Eppstein for his lucid page on dynamic programming and
	the Longest Common Subsequences problem, which provided 2/3 of
	the inspiration for this project.

Thanks to the countless folks who showed up in comp.lang.perl.misc
	every month asking `how can I do `diff' in Perl' for the other
	1/3 of the inspiration.
