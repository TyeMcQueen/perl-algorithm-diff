This is a module for computing the difference between two files, two
strings, or any other two lists of things.  It uses an  intelligent
algorithm similar to (or identical to) the one used by the Unix `diff'
program.   It is guaranteed to find the *smallest possible* set of
differences.  

This package contains a few parts:

Algorithm::Diff
	Module that contains the `diff' function, which computes the
	differences betwen two lists and returns a data structure that
	represents these differences.  You can then use the data
	structure to generate a formatted output in whatever format
	you like.  The `diff' programs included in this package use
	Algorithm::Diff::diff to find the differences, and then
	theyjust format the output.  

	Algorithm::Diff also includes some other useful functions such
	as `LCS', which computes the longest common subsequence of two
	lists.

	A::D is suitable for many other uses.  For example, you could
	use it for finding the smallest set of differences between two
	strings, or for computing the most efficient way to update the
	screen if you were replacing `curses'.

diff.pl
	Implementation of `diff' in Perl that is as simple as possible
	so that you can see how it works.  The output format is not
	compatible with regular `diff'.

cdiff.pl
	Christian Murphy's `diff' that produces real diffs that you
	can feed to `patch'.

THANKS SECTION

Thanks to Christian Murphy for writing `cdiff.pl'.  In this world
	there are the talkers and the doers, and Christian is
	obviously a doer.  

Thanks to Tim Bunce for his code that I haven't incorporated yet.

Thanks to David Eppstein for his lucid page on dynamic programming and
	the Longest Common Subsequences problem, which provided 2/3 of
	the inspiration for this project.

Thanks to the countless folks who showed up in comp.lang.perl.misc
	every month asking `how can I do `diff' in Perl' for the other
	1/3 of the inspiration.
